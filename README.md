Technologies used thus far:
    jupyter notebooks
    vscode
    
libraries used:
    scikit-learn
    keras
    pandas

ideas to implement:
    - make a "what-if" generator of if money(a user inputted value) was invested on each predicted good day
    - output prediction for next day, week, month, quarter, and year
    - maybe twitter sentiment to factor into labeling
    - front end to make user input process smoother
    - make index ambiguous
    - look for indexes that are oprn over night
    - add new updates like interest rates
    - add maybe key stocks or sector information
    - increase/decrease resolution: monthly, hourly data, tick data, minute data
    add more...
